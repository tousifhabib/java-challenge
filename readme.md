#### My experience in Java

I have a fair amount of experience with Java (and Kotlin) and Spring Boot (approximately 3 years on and off).
As a person who has been in the technology/software consulting field for a while I have a wide breadth
of experience in various stacks and I believe that many skills are transferable between languages and frameworks.
As such I believe that the language being used is not important as long as the fundamentals are good and the
final product is of high quality (and most importantly is working and maintainable).
